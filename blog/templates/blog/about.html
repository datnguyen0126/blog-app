    <b class="text-primary">About</b> 
    A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, 
    a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. 
    If youâ€™re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. 
    Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.
